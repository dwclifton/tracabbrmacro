= !AbbrMacro =

== Description ==

AbbrMacro returns an <abbr> or <acronym> element with a title attribute.

If you've used InlineMacro to create abbreviation or acronym elements in your
[WikiFormatting formatted] wiki pages, you probably quickly realized how tedious
that can be. The !AbbrMacro package is designed to alleviate all that.

It accepts keyword syntax only:

{{{
[[Abbr(abbr=XYZ,title=Xenon Yeti Zulu,<tag=abbr|acronym>)]]
}}}

Where the `tag` keyword is optional and defaults to `acronym`. Why is acronym
the default? For several reasons. First, most users are after acronyms (and as
far as I know there are no plans for a `initialism` element). Second, Internet
Explorer through version 8.x does not support the `<abbr>` element.

== Definitions File ==

!AbbrMacro is designed to be rolled out in phases. The first and simpliest use
case I've already described. But even that can become tedious, especially if
you use the same acronyms over and over. The second phase will introduce a
user-defined text file of abbr/title pairs which will allow the omission
of the title keyword. Assuming, that is, there is a matching abbreviation in
the definition file.

To configure the location of the definitions file, add the following  entry to
your project `trac.ini`:

{{{
[abbreviations]
file = /path/to/your/abbreviations/file
}}}

The file must be readable (and eventually writable, see below) by your Web
server in order for this feature to work. Like all Python/Trac configuration
files, strings beginning with a `#` (pound) character are treated as commments
and will be ignored.

The format of the definitions file couldn't be simpler:

{{{
PEP = Python Enhancement Proposal
PHP = Hypertext Preprocesor
RFC = Request For Comments
...
}}}

Where leading and trailing whitespace is removed.

A third and final phase will allow the user to edit this file from within the
wiki, similar to the InterMapTxt page for InterWiki links.

== Installation ==

Download the [zipfile] from here or from [ Trac Hacks], unzip the archive to a
temporary location, visit the `0.11` folder and run:

{{{
python setup.py bdist_egg
cp dist/*.egg /trac/env/Project/plugins
}}}

== Configuration ==

Enable the macro in:

/trac/env/Project/conf/trac.ini:

{{{
[components]
abbr.* = enabled
}}}

You may have to restart your Web server.

== Example ==

{{{
[[Abbr(abbr=PEP,title=Python Enhancement Proposal)]]
}}}
